This is a Blog for one of my school clubs, the [VC Urban Economics club](https://vcue.ayo.icu).

# VC Urban Economics

You can pretty much git clone the repo and change the landing page, then it will work like a normal blog. 

Editor is at /admin/editor, before you can access the site you'll have to edit the postgres DB and set your own account to have the 'admin' and 'writer' priveleges.
